# What is color-rg?
color-rg is search and refacotry tool base on ripgrep.

I'm a big fans of color-moccur.el, this extension's name is used for tribute color-moccur.el!

# Installation

Put `color-rg.el` to your load-path.
The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
```Elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
(require color-rg)
```
